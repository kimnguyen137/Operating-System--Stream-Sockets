# Operating-System--Stream-Sockets
Two programs that stream sockets between each others: First client program that will connect with your server and send it requests for the weather report for a given city. Second server program that will wait for connection requests from your client and exchange one-line text messages with it.

## SPECIFICATION
You are to write two programs:
1. A client program that will connect with your server and send it requests for the weather report for a given city.
2. A server program that will wait for connection requests from your client and exchange one-line text messages with it.

### The Server Program
Your server must start by reading in a file named weather20.txt that will contain a list of cities with their next day maximum temperatures and sky conditions as in:
```
Amarillo,61,Sunny
Austin,76,Partly Cloudy
Corpus Christi,79,AM Thunderstorms
Dallas,65,Sunny
El Paso,67,Sunny
Galveston,69,Thunderstorms
Houston,77,AM Thunderstorms
San Antonio,79,Mostly Cloudy
``` 
with the three field separated by commas. It should then prompt for a port to listen to as in:
##### Enter server port number: 2468
It will then create a stream socket, bind it to the specified port number, do a listen() to specify a maximum number of queued connection requests and do an accept() that will let it wait for connection requests.

Whenever the server accepts a connection request, it will receive a city name and reply to the client with the day’s maximum temperature and sky condition. Additionally—and for debugging purposes—the server should print out the name of the city in the client request, its next day maximum temperature and its sky condition as in:
```
Weather report for Houston
Tomorrow’s maximum temperature is 77 F
Tomorrow’s sky condition is AM Thunderstorms
or
Weather report for Brussels
No data
```
Once it has done it, it should send to the client a single message with the requested data.

### The Client Program
Your client should start by prompting the user for a server host name and a server port number as in:
```
Enter the server host name: localhost
Enter the server port number: 2468
```
Please note that localhost is the sole correct answer if you run your two programs on a computer lacking a full internet name.
It should then create a stream socket, do a connect() request to the specified server, and prompt the user for a city name, and send that name to the server:
```
Enter a city name: Corpus Christi
Tomorrow’s maximum temperature is 78 F
Tomorrow’s sky condition is AM Thunderstorms
or
Enter a city name: Brussels
No data
```
